# In order to run this application

All you need to do is open `index.html` in your browser.  You can probably just
drag and drop `index.html` into your browser or double click it.  However, if that doesn't work, you may need
to type the full file path into your address bar.

i.e. `file:///home/jrforce/project/feedreader/index.html`

Wait a few moments for the tests to run and scroll to the bottom of the page to see the test statuses.
